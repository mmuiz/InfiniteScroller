# InfiniteScroller

## Motivation

Well in my apps I always deal with the same things again. Every scrolling screen which displays paged data needs to load next page some time. To save some time I created this microlibrary which should deal with everything that is necessary. 

## Usage

## Installation

_InfiniteScroller_ is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Just add it to your Cartfile:

```
github "olejnjak/InfiniteScroller"
```

Or add it to your Podfile if you're using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) ðŸ˜Ž

```
pod "InfiniteScroller"
```

If you're familiar with integrating manually it's your turn ðŸ™‚. Or if you'd love to use a different way of integration, PRs are welcome ðŸ™‚
