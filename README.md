# InfiniteScroller

Microlibrary which simplifies implementation of infinite scroll in `UIScrollView`.

## Motivation

Well in my apps I always deal with the same things again. Every scrolling screen which displays paged data needs to load next page some time. To save some time I created this microlibrary which should deal with everything that is necessary. Every time when user reaches a treshold, the caller is notified and can perform e.g. a network request which fetches new page of data.

## Usage

Usage is very simple. Just create an instance of `InfiniteScroller` with the scrollView you want paged.

```swift
let infiniteScroller = InfiniteScroll(scrollView: scrollView)
```

Add the next page callback.

```swift
infiniteScroller.nextPageAction = { [weak self] completion in
    loadNextPage { completion() }
}
```

**Remember to call the `completion` callback when loading next page finishes**

And that's all. Remember that if you loose any reference to the `InfiniteScroller` instance, it will get deallocated and you will not receive any callbacks so you have to keep strong reference somewhere (e.g. in the view controller).
